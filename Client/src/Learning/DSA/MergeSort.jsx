            <p> Merge sort is a way of arranging a list of things in order. It works by repeatedly dividing the list into smaller parts until each part has only one item. Then, it combines (merges) these small parts back together in a sorted order. This process ensures that the entire list ends up sorted. 
                Merge sort is known for being a reliable and efficient method for sorting things. </p>
